I love surprises. Although I'm generally pretty terrible at keeping secrets, I love the planning involved in a surprise. Knowing that you'll really make that person's day is just magical. So, helping to plan a surprise for my wonderful Mama's birthday was a real joy.

Wakehurst is the little sister garden of Kew, and is based in West Sussex in the South of England. As birthday surprise locations go, this was pretty spectacular.

After the initial shock of seeing 2 of her children and their partners spring out from behind the bushes, Mum had recovered enough to walk the gardens and stop into the impressive Mansion.

The walled garden was a particular highlight for us, especially the elegant alliums, red campions, the buzz of the bees and the insect hotel.

Wakehurst is set in over 500 acres of garden and woodland and includes a nature reserve, meaning there's plenty to occupy you for the day. It also houses the Millennium Seed Bank: "the largest wild seed conservation project in the world".

If you enjoy Kew (and I think this blog is perfect evidence of my ongoing love affair with the Royal Gardens), then Wakehurst should definitely feature on your to-do list soon. And, if you can bring your loved ones together for the visit, even better.

###The useful bits:###

- [Wakehurst](https://www.kew.org/wakehurst/plan-your-visit-to-wakehurst) is around an hour out of London. Take the train from Victoria to Haywards Heath, then a local bus for the final 6 miles to the garden entrance.
- The entry fee is Â£12.95 or free if you're a Friend of Kew or a National Trust member (both definitely worth looking into if you're planning repeat visits).
- Sadly, no dogs are allowed in the gardens.

I think we can all agree that this weekend was GLORIOUS. Even better when your friends are coming to visit (and with their beautiful labrador no less).

Keen to make the most of the unseasonably warm weather, albeit a little stumped deciding how many layers to wear, we headed to Box Hill for an 11km circular walk.

It's my fourth time walking this route, and I just love it. It gives you exactly what you'd look for in a country walk: rolling green fields, dense woodland (pine and deciduous), stunning views and a pub perfectly located at the halfway point.

Note: some of the pictures from our day out aren't as crisp as we'd normally like. Serves us right for faffing about with the ISO settings willy nilly!

###The useful bits:###
- The walk starts and ends at Box Hill & Westhumble station, so it's ideally located especially if you don't have access to a car.
- Train services to Boxhill & Westhumble go from London Victoria roughly once an hour, and take around an hour to arrive.
- I found our walking route on the [Saturday Walkers Club website](https://www.walkingclub.org.uk/walk/box-hill-circular/) and couldn't recommend it more highly. The directions are comprehensive, accurate and absolutely charming.
- The [King William IV pub](http://www.thekingwilliamiv.com/) is perfectly located for a lunch time stop. Although it advertises its pub food as 'no frills', we've yet to be disappointed!
- When you arrive at Box Hill, don't be disappointed to find that the coffee shops closes at 4pm, as we were. Sorry again, Andrew...

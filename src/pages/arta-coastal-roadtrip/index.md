We're currently mid-planning our summer holiday to Italy in June, and naturally I've found myself reminiscing about past travels and adventures. In particular, a wonderful mini roadtrip to the historic town of Artà, Mallorca - a delight tucked away in the north-east corner of this island jewel.

We parked on the outskirts of the town, and immediately fell in love with the crumbling buildings and faded glamour. Perfect for strolls in the sun, taking in the history and perhaps an ice cream or two...?!

We didn't have any preconceptions or items to tick off our list, so we thoroughly enjoyed strolling the streets and taking in the local sights. I particularly loved the tall and slightly imposing cactuses dotted around.

In search of ice cream, we stumbled upon the [Museu Regional D'Artà](http://www.artamallorca.travel/en/what-to-visit/27/regional-museum-of-arta), a museum founded by a group of local scholars in the 1920s.

For such a small town (population around 7,000) and such an unassuming building, the museum was a real archaeological treasure trove. Artifacts on display dated back to Roman times, and their collection of taxidermy birds was impressive (albeit a little morbid!).

Keen to head back out into the balearic sun, we followed sign posts to the church at the top of the hill: Iglesia de Transfiguración del Señor.

From here, the views were spectacular, and the glittering blue sea in the distance (not pictured) was incredibly enticing!

But first? [Santuari de Sant Salvador](https://www.seemallorca.com/castles/santuari-de-sant-salvador-arta-688512): a 14th century fortress with beautiful ramparts, a rich history defending the small town and even better views.

After the short climb up to the fortress, we'd worked up the sort of appetite only tapas can properly sate.

Tummies full and feet keen for more exploring, we spent the afternoon searching for more views of Mallorca's stunning rugged coastline. Suffice to say, we weren't disappointed.

A final stop at the beach to feel the crisp sand between our toes and the warm sea lap at our ankles, and then home to our hotel in Sa Coma: sun-kissed, sleepy and satisfied.

###The useful bits:###

- [This website](https://www.seemallorca.com/arta) is a great resource to find out more about the history of Artà. We missed the caves mentioned - next time!
- We can't quite remember the entry price for the Museu Regional D'Artà, but we do remember that it was cheap: maybe 2 euros each.
- The [Santuari de Sant Salvador](https://www.seemallorca.com/castles/santuari-de-sant-salvador-arta-688512) is not to be confused with its larger relative based on the south-east coast (with accompanying Christ the Redeemer-esque statue).
